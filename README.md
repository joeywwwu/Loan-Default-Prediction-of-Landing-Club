# Loan Default Prediction of Landing Club

## About:
In this project, I aim to analyze and predict various outcomes related to our dataset. The main objective is to apply data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and several machine learning models to derive meaningful insights and predictions. This project covers multiple stages from data collection to model evaluation.

## Methods:
### 1. Data Collection
We gathered data from multiple sources, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Wrangling
Ensured data was prepped for exploratory analysis and machine learning models. This included handling missing values, normalizing data, and selecting relevant features.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted data visualization of key parameters, performed filtering and representation of data, and mapped relevant records to understand data distributions and relationships.

### 4. Supervised Machine Learning - Classification
Performed predictive analysis using classification models. Standardized data were split into train/test sets and fit using several types of classification models. Best parameters were chosen using grid search techniques before assessing model accuracy for the best-fit model from each type.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Implemented cross-validation to ensure model robustness. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC-AUC scores.

## Results
- Analyzed the geographic distribution and other key characteristics of the dataset.
- Identified important features contributing to the predictive power of our models.
- Implemented and evaluated multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM to predict target outcomes.
- Tuned models using 5-fold cross-validation, achieving high accuracy and robust performance metrics.

## Key Insights
- Our analysis provided significant insights into the factors influencing the outcomes in our dataset.
- Achieved high predictive accuracy with our best models, ensuring reliable predictions for future data.
- Detailed findings and visualizations are included in the project deliverables.
